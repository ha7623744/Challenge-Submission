# Challenge-Submission

1.	Created a login system that prompts user to enter name and government ID. If incorrect ID is entered, user must re-enter their ID. Program works as intended when tested.
2.	Made the login system into a procedure that is called at the start of the main code. Program works as intended when tested.
3.	Created a logout system in a procedure that logs the user out of the system, terminating the code. Put the logout system into another procedure that calls after the login procedure. Program works as intended when tested.
4.	Created a search system in a procedure that prompts the user to enter searches. Once user exits the search system, their search history is displayed. Program works as intended when tested.
5.	Swapped around procedure calls so they work intuitively. Also looped back to search procedure if user doesn't want to logout. When tested, any result other than yes/no ends the program early when being asked if user wants to logout.
6.	Added an else to the if statement to fix previous issue. Program now works as intended when tested.
